Hello There, This is Austin Fulford

Making a quick writeup to describe my experience.

I am a self-funded college graduate who had to put himself through school without loans and did so successfully. 
During my tenure I met many interesting people from a variety of backgrounds and was exposed to more cultures than I ever thought I could living in Florida.

Due to my experience in college I have quickly accessible knowledge in:
Front end technologies like HMTL, JS, and CSS
Backend technologies like MySQL, Azure, and PHP
Amongst those I also have skills in C#, C++, BASIC, and even have dabbled in Unity for scripting and game development.

I will wrap this very brief, brief, up here but if you have any further questions please don't hesitate to contact me!
